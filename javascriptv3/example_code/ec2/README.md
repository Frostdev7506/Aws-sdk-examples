# Amazon EC2 code examples for the SDK for JavaScript V3

## Overview

Shows how to use the AWS SDK for JavaScript V3 to work with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

<!--custom.overview.start-->
<!--custom.overview.end-->

*Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity—literally, servers in Amazon's data centers—that you use to build and host your software systems.*

## ⚠ Important

* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

* [Start an instance](actions/start-instances.js#L8) (`StartInstances`)
* [Stop an instance](actions/stop-instances.js#L8) (`StopInstances`)
* [Terminate an instance](actions/terminate-instances.js#L8) (`TerminateInstances`)

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple
functions within the same service.

* [Get started with instances](scenarios/basic.js) 

## Run the examples

### Prerequisites

For prerequisites, see the [README](../../README.md#Prerequisites) in the `javascriptv3` folder.

<!--custom.prerequisites.start-->
<!--custom.prerequisites.end-->

### Instructions

**Note**: All code examples are written in ECMAscript 6 (ES6). For guidelines on converting to CommonJS, see
[JavaScript ES6/CommonJS syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/sdk-examples-javascript-syntax.html).

**Run a single action**

```bash
node ./actions/<fileName>
```

**Run a scenario**

```bash
node ./scenarios/<fileName>
```

<!--custom.instructions.start-->
<!--custom.instructions.end-->

#### Hello Amazon EC2

This example shows you how to get started using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

```bash
node ./hello.js
```

#### Get started with instances

This example shows you how to do the following:

* Create a key pair that is used to secure SSH communication between your computer and an EC2 instance.
* Create a security group that acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
* Find an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and a compatible instance type.
* Create an instance that is created from the instance type and AMI you select, and is configured to use the security group and key pair created in this example.
* Stop and restart the instance.
* Create an Elastic IP address and associate it as a consistent IP address for your instance.
* Connect to your instance with SSH, using both its public IP address and your Elastic IP address.
* Clean up all of the resources created by this example.

To find instructions for running these tests, see the [README](../../README.md#Tests)
in the `javascriptv3` folder.

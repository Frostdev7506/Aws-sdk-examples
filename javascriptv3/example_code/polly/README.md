# Amazon Polly JavaScript SDK v3 code examples
Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, 
and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. 

## Code examples
This is a workspace where you can find the following AWS SDK for JavaScript version 3 (v3) Amazon Polly examples. 
- [Convert text to speech - Node.js](./general-examples/src/polly_synthesize_to_s3.js)

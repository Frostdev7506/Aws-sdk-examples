# Cloudwatch examples for the AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3)

## Overview

These code examples demonstrate how to work with Amazon CloudWatch
using the AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3).

Amazon CloudWatch provides a reliable, scalable, and flexible monitoring solution that you can start using within minutes.
You no longer need to set up, manage, and scale your own monitoring systems and infrastructure.

## ⚠️ Important

- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

- We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
- This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

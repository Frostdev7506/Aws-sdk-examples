# Amazon EventBridge JavaScript SDK v3 code examples

## Purpose
The code examples in this directory demonstrate how to work with Amazon EventBridge 
using the AWS SDK for JavaScript version 3 (v3).

Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon Web Services resources. 
When your resources change state, they automatically send events to an event stream. You can create 
rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. 

## Code Examples

### API Examples
- [Put CloudWatch events](src/putEvents.js)
- [Put CloudWatch event rule](src/putRule.js)
- [Put CloudWatch event targets](src/putTargets.js)

**Note**: All code examples are written in ECMAscript 6 (ES6). For guidelines on converting to CommonJS, see 
[JavaScript ES6/CommonJS syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/sdk-examples-javascript-syntax.html).

## Important

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
- This code has not been tested in all AWS Regions. Some AWS services are 
  available only in specific AWS Regions. For more information, see the 
  [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)
  on the AWS website.
- Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.

## Running the code

### Prerequisites
- An AWS account. To create an account, see [How do I create and activate a new AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) on the AWS Premium Support website.
- AWS credentials. For details, see  [Setting credentials in Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) in the 
  *AWS SDK for Javascript (v3) Developer Guide*.


1. Clone the [AWS Code Samples repo](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) to your local environment. 
See [the Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for 
instructions.

2. Install the dependencies listed in the package.json.

**Note**: These dependencies include the client modules for the AWS services that this example requires, 
which include *@aws-sdk/client-eventbridge*.
```
npm install node -g 
cd javascriptv3/example_code/eventbridge 
npm install
```
3. In your text editor, update user variables specified in the ```Inputs``` section of the sample file.

4. Run sample code:
```
cd src
node [example name].js 
```

## Unit tests

`Unit tests<./tests>`_ are provided for most examples, using the `Jest <https://jestjs.io/>`_ framework.

For example, to run tests on the eventbridge folder, enter the following sequence of commands at the command prompt:

```
npm install node -g
cd javascriptv3/example_code/eventbridge/tests
npm install
npm test
```
